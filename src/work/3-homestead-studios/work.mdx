### Features

The goal was to gain fluency with React Hooks, Material UI, and noSQL. The Project's page was created with images displayed with a masonery layout, and a preview component that allows users to navigate back and forth between images. Images are stored with Firebase backend services. Authorized users can add, edit, and delete from the Projects page. Users can also get a cost estimate by answering a series of questions that calculate the estimate based on the answers. The project is complete with a contact us page that uses Google Cloud Functions & Node Mailer.
